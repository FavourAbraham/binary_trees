# 0x1D. C - Binary trees

This project implements basic binary tree data structures and functions in C, adhering to certain guidelines and constraints.

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a flexible and efficient implementation of basic binary trees using the C programming language. It includes definitions for different types of binary trees such as basic binary trees, binary search trees (BST), AVL trees, and max binary heaps. The project also provides various functions to manipulate and traverse these binary tree structures.

## Contents

The project consists of the following files:

- `binary_trees.h`: Header file containing structure definitions and function prototypes for binary trees.
- Source files containing the implementation of various functions for binary trees:
  - `1-binary_tree_insert_left.c
  - `2-binary_tree_insert_right.c`
  - `3-binary_tree_delete.c`
  - `4-binary_tree_is_leaf.c`
  - `5-binary_tree_is_root.c`
- `main.c`: Main program file (optional, for testing purposes).
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.
